      description: "The next iteration of the Freedom is Rising Freedom, and it's looking FRESH. It features a very Wing-esque transformation gimmick that is aided by part-swapping to ensure stability in both modes, and new slide gimmicks have been incorporated in the waist parts for a wide variety of dynamic posing options upon completion. Two types of shield are also included, and the physical one can be displayed in stored or deployed mode. Get ready for the next evolution of Gundam Seed!",

As with the Rising Freedom Gundam, new articulation gimmicks have been incorporated in the waist to allow for even more dynamic Gundam Seed-like poses, and a mix of physical and beam accessories are included so you can choose the form that best fits your aesthetic. Not only that, but a new Wing-like transformation has been incorporated!",

A wide range of slide gimmicks have also been incorporated to allow for uninhibited posing in the legs and torso for a wide range of motion. We can't wait to see this thing in person!",

This thing rules! It has that same great Witch from Mercury articulation and stability, and the massive sword can be attached to the back in stored or deployed mode! The kit is also compatible with the separately-sold Witch from Mercury Weapon Display Base for plenty of posing options upon completion.",

The kit is equipped with the 'multi-link' gimmick that allows armor panels to slide and separate in conjunction with the movement of the joints, allowing for a wide range of dynamic posing options like you've never seen on a Hi-Nu before! Waist parts assure that the articulation of the legs is not hindered, and the 'Advanced MS Joint' system will allow you to capture any pose you want with stability! In short, this thing is unbelievably cool!!",
